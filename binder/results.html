<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Experiment 1: <em>Q</em> vs. <em>O</em></h2>
<p>In Experiment 1, we examined discrimination judgments between the two letters <em>Q</em> and <em>O</em>. Based on a search asymmetry for these letters <span class="citation">(<em>Q</em>s are found faster than <em>O</em>s than vice-versa; Treisman and Souther 1985)</span>, we hypothesized that a similar asymmetry would emerge in subjective confidence judgments, such that metacognitive sensitivity for <em>Q</em> responses will be higher than for <em>O</em> responses. We used the letter <em>Z</em> as our backward mask.</p>
<p>205 participants were recruited from Prolific for Experiment 1.</p>
<p>Median completion time was 13.12 minutes. Mean accuracy was 0.74. Participants reported seeing an <em>O</em> on 0.47 of the trials. Overall we excluded 71 participants based on our exclusion criteria, leaving 134 participants for the main analysis. Due to a technical error in data collection, this figure is higher than that specified in our preregistration document (N=106). Going forward, only data from included participants is analyzed.</p>
<p>Mean accuracy among the included participants was <span class="math inline">\(M = 0.74\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.73\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.75]\)</span>. Mean SOA in the last trial was <span class="math inline">\(M = 47.50\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([39.39\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(55.61]\)</span>. Participants showed no consistent bias in their responses (quantified as the probability of a ‘Q’ response minus 0.5; <span class="math inline">\(M = 0.02\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.00\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.04]\)</span>). On a scale of 0 to 1, mean confidence level was <span class="math inline">\(M = 0.49\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.45\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.53]\)</span>. Confidence was higher for correct than for incorrect responses (<span class="math inline">\(M_d = 0.15\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.13\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.17]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(133) = 14.85\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>).</p>
<p><em>Hypothesis 1</em>: In line with our hypothesis, confidence was generally higher for <em>Q</em> (feature present) responses than for <em>O</em> (feature absent) responses (<span class="math inline">\(t(133) = 7.52\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>; Cohen’s d = 0.65; <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BF}_{\textrm{10}} = 1.07 \times 10^{9}\)</span>; see Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:all-distributions">3.1</a>, panel 1).</p>
<p><em>Hypothesis 2</em>: In order to measure metacognitive asymmetry, we extracted the response-conditional type-2 ROC (rc-ROC) curves for the two responses (<em>Q</em> and <em>O</em>) in the discrimination task. This was done by plotting the cumulative distribution of confidence ratings (high to low) for correct responses against the same distribution for incorrect responses. The area under the rc-ROC curve (auROC) was then taken as a measure of metacognitive sensitivity <span class="citation">(Kanai, Walsh, and Tseng 2010; Meuwese et al. 2014)</span>. In line with our hypothesis, auROC for <em>Q</em> responses (<span class="math inline">\(M = 0.72\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.70\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.74]\)</span>) was higher than for <em>O</em> responses (<span class="math inline">\(M = 0.68\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.66\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.70]\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(t(133) = 2.96\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .002\)</span>; Cohen’s d = 0.26; <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BF}_{\textrm{10}} = 6.56\)</span>; see Figure <a href="results.html#fig:all-rcROCs">3.2</a>, panel 1), similar to the documented metacognitive asymmetry for detection judgments.</p>
<p><em>Hypothesis 3</em>: Metacognitive asymmetry was not significantly higher than what is expected based on an equal-variance SDT model with the same response bias and sensitivity as the subjects (<span class="math inline">\(t(133) = 0.97\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .167\)</span>; Cohen’s d=0.08). A Bayes Factor indicated that our results are more likely under a model that assumes no additional metacognitive asymmetry (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BF}_{\textrm{01}} = 6.07\)</span>).</p>
<p><em>Hypothesis 4</em>: In line with our hypothesis, <em>Q</em> responses were faster on average than <em>O</em> responses by 37 ms. (<span class="math inline">\(t(133) = -2.99\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .002\)</span> ; Cohen’s d = 0.26; <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BF}_{\textrm{10}} = 7.05\)</span>; see Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:all-distributions">3.1</a>, panel 1).</p>
<p>In summary, in Experiment 1 we found that <em>Q</em> responses were faster and accompanied by higher subjective confidence, in line with a processing advantage for feature-presence. Metacognitive asymmetry however did not go beyond what is expected from an equal-variance SDT model for these stimuli, taking into account response biases.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Experiment 2: C vs. O</h2>
<p>In Experiment 2, we examined discrimination judgments between the two letters <em>C</em> and <em>O</em>. Based on a search asymmetry for these letters <span class="citation">(<em>C</em>s are found faster among <em>O</em>s than vice versa; Treisman and Souther 1985; Takeda and Yagi 2000; Treisman and Gormican 1988)</span>, we hypothesized that a similar asymmetry would emerge in subjective confidence judgments, such that metacognitive sensitivity for perceiving a <em>C</em> will be higher than for perceiving an <em>O</em>. We used the letter <em>Z</em> as our backward mask.</p>
<p>143 participants were recruited from Prolific for Experiment 2.</p>
<p>Median completion time was 12.80 minutes. Mean accuracy was 0.75, and participants reported seeing an <em>O</em> on 0.43 of the trials. Overall we excluded 37 participants, leaving 106 participants for the main analysis. Going forward, only data from included participants is analyzed.</p>
<p>Mean accuracy among included participants was <span class="math inline">\(M = 0.74\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.73\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.75]\)</span>. The mean SOA of the last trial was <span class="math inline">\(M = 40.18\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([34.37\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(46.00]\)</span>. Participants showed a consistent bias toward reporting a <em>C</em> rather than an <em>O</em> (<span class="math inline">\(M = 0.07\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.05\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.08]\)</span>). On a scale of 0 to 1, mean confidence level was <span class="math inline">\(M = 0.52\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.48\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.56]\)</span>. Confidence was higher for correct than for incorrect responses (<span class="math inline">\(M_d = 0.17\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.15\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.19]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(105) = 15.05\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>).</p>
<p><em>Hypothesis 1</em>: In line with our hypothesis, confidence was generally higher for <em>C</em> (feature present) responses than for <em>O</em> (feature absent) responses (<span class="math inline">\(M_d = 0.05\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.03\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\infty]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t(105) = 3.59\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>; Cohen’s d = 0.35; <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BF}_{\textrm{10}} = 42.62\)</span>; see Figure <a href="results.html#fig:all-rcROCs">3.2</a>, panel 2).</p>
<p><em>Hypothesis 2</em>: Opposite to our prediction, auROC for <em>C</em> responses (<span class="math inline">\(M = 0.70\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.68\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.72]\)</span>) was <em>lower</em> than for <em>O</em> responses (<span class="math inline">\(M = 0.75\)</span>, 95% CI <span class="math inline">\([0.73\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.78]\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(t(105) = -3.53\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; .999\)</span>; Cohen’s d = 0.34; see Figure <a href="results.html#fig:all-rcROCs">3.2</a>, panel 2.). Bayes Factor strongly supported the alternative (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BF}_{\textrm{10}} = 35.19\)</span>). Note that our prior on effect sizes was symmetric around zero, such that support for the alternative is obtained for negative, as well as positive effects.</p>
<p><em>Hypothesis 3</em>: Metacognitive sensitivity for <em>C</em> responses was still significantly higher than for <em>O</em> responses after controlling for bias (Cohen’s d=0.49; <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BF}_{\textrm{10}} = 6.46 \times 10^{3}\)</span>).</p>
<p><em>Hypothesis 4</em>: Contrary to our hypothesis, response times for <em>C</em> and for <em>O</em> responses were highly similar, with a median difference of 6 ms. (<span class="math inline">\(t(105) = 0.01\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .504\)</span> ; Cohen’s d = 0.00; <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BF}_{\textrm{01}} = 8.57\)</span>; see Figure <a href="results.html#fig:all-rcROCs">3.2</a>, panel 2).</p>
<p>In summary, in Experiment 2 we found a dissociation between our two confidence-related measures. As we hypothesized, participants were generally more confident in their <em>C</em> (feature present) responses, but their metacognitive sensitivity was higher following <em>O</em> (feature absent) responses. We found no reliable difference in response times between these two responses.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Experiment 3: tilted vs. vertical lines</h2>
<p>In Experiment 3, we examind discrimination judgments between tilted and vertical lines. Based on a search asymmetry for these stimuli <span class="citation">(tilted lines are found faster among vertical lines than vice versa; Treisman and Gormican 1988)</span>, we hypothesized that a similar asymmetry would emerge in subjective confidence judgments, such that metacognitive sensitivity for perceiving a tilted line will be higher than for perceiving a vertical line. As described in section <a href="methods.html#deviations">2.6</a>, overly high accuracy in the first few participants led us to change our masking stimulus, first to an overlay of all stimuli and then to four dollar signs. We present here the combined results from these last two cohorts of participants. The results were qualitatively similar in the two cohorts.</p>
<p>304 participants were recruited from Prolific for Experiment 3.</p>

<p>In summary, in Experiment 5 we found no sign of processing asymmetry between upward and downward-tilted cubes in response-times and confidence.

In accordance with our pre-registered plan to commit to the Bayes Factor analysis in interpreting the results, in what follows we interpret these findings as providing no support for a metacognitive asymmetry for upward and downward tilted cubes.</p>

In Experiment 5, discrimination between upward-tilted and downward-tilted cubes showed no asymmetry in response time, confidence, or metacognitive sensitivity. In Experiment 6, participants were less confident and slower in their reports of seeing a flipped N, contrary to our prediction that default-violating signals should be easier to perceive.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.8</span> Experiment 7 (exploratory): grating vs. noise</h2>
<p>Results from Experiments 1-6 revealed that search asymmetry is not always accompanied by an asymmetry in metacognitive sensitivity. Given that we did not observe a true metacognitive asymmetry in the expected direction for any of our stimulus pairs, we were concerned that our experimental design may have been unsuitable for detecting classical metacognitive asymmetries in detection, for example due to an insufficient number of trials, the masking procedure, or the confidence report scheme. As a positive control, we collected data for an additional experiment that more closely resembled typical detection experiments. In this experiment, participants discriminated between two stimuli: random noise and a noisy grating (presented to participants as a ‘zebra’ stimulus; see Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:rcROC7">3.4</a>). In a previous lab-based study, similar stimuli produced a robust metacognitive asymmetry between target absent (noise) and target present (noisy grating) responses <span class="citation">(Mazor, Friston, and Fleming 2020)</span>. We used black and white concentric circles as a mask. Apart from the choice of stimuli and mask, the procedure was identical to that of our pre-registered experiments.</p>

<!-- Examining the response-conditional ROC curves, we noticed that some participants had response-conditional ROC curves that were defined by one or two points only (apart from the (0,0) and (1,1) points). In our study, this happened when participants made only a few errors of a certain type (for example, mistaking an *O* for a *Q*). This was the case for many of the feature-absent ROC curves in Experiments 3 and 4 (global features), due to a general bias to report seeing the feature-present stimulus in these experiments. Response-conditional ROC curves that are defined by only a few points are noisy and unreliable, and may have masked true effects of metacognitive asymmetry. To look into this, we repeated the analysis for Hypotheses 2 and 3 after ensuring that all participants had at least 5 errors of each type (instead of 2; included N = 105, 76, 44, 51, 78, 89 for experiments 1-6, respectively). For this subset of our participants, the unexpected metacognitive asymmetry in Experiment 2 (*O*>*C*) was no longer supported (H2: $\mathrm{BF}_{\textrm{01}} = 2.48$; H3: $\mathrm{BF}_{\textrm{10}} = 2.83$). For all other experiments, this additional exclusion criterion did not change the qualitative pattern of our results.  -->

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.9.1</span> zROC analysis</h3>
<p>In a signal-detection framework, metacognitive asymmetry appears when the signal distribution has both a higher mean and higher variance than that of the noise distribution. This unequal variance setting produces higher metacognitive sensitivity for judgments of signal presence, compared to judgments of signal absence. A direct measure for the ratio between the variances of the two distributions is the slope of the <em>type-1 zROC curve</em>. A zROC curve is constructed by applying the inverse of the normal cumulative density function to false alarm and hit rates for different confidence thresholds. The slope of the zROC curve equals 1 exactly when the variance of the signal and noise distributions are equal. In detection experiments, the slope is often shallower than 1, indicating a wider signal distribution. Indeed, in our positive control experiment (Exp. 7), the median zROC slope was 0.86 and significantly shallower than 1 (<span class="math inline">\(t(103) = -5.08\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BF}_{\textrm{10}} = 8.66 \times 10^{3}\)</span> for a t-test on the log-slope against zero). Measuring the slope of the zROC curve in our six pre-registered experiments, we asked whether our ‘feature-present’ distributions had higher variance than our ‘feature-absent’ distributions.</p>
<p>zROC slopes were numerically shallower than one in Experiments 1 (Q vs. O; median slope = 0.95), 3 (line tilt; median slope = 0.94), 4 (line curvature; 0.97) and 5 (cube orientation; 0.95). This was significant only in Experiment 5 (<span class="math inline">\(t(101) = -2.09\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .039\)</span>). In agreement with the results of our rcROC analysis, the zROC slope in Exp. 2 (C vs. O) was significantly higher than one, suggesting that the representation of the letter ‘O’ was more variable than that of the letter ‘C’ (median slope = 1.09; <span class="math inline">\(t(104) = 2.29\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .024\)</span>).</p>
<p>Previous studies reported similar variance structures for these stimuli when presented in visual search arrays. For example, confidence in a vertical/tilted visual search task revealed higher variance in the representation of tilted (feature positive) compared to vertical (feature negative) stimuli <span class="citation">(Vincent 2011)</span>. Similarly, reverse correlation analysis revealed higher variance in the representation of <em>Q</em> (feature positive) compared to <em>O</em> (feature negative) stimuli <span class="citation">(Saiki 2008)</span>. Finally, and in agreement with our results, variance in the representation of <em>O</em> (feature negative) was found to be higher than in the representation of <em>C</em> (feature positive) <span class="citation">(Dosher, Han, and Lu 2004)</span>. Note that for the case of line tilt and <em>Q</em> vs. <em>O</em>, finding a high-variance target among low-variance distractors is easier than finding a low-variance target among high-variance distractors. However, the opposite is true for <em>C</em> vs. <em>O</em>, where a low-variance target (<em>C</em>) renders the search easier. This last observation challenges the suggestion that variance structure is the determining factor for visual search asymmetries <span class="citation">(Treisman and Gormican 1988; Dosher, Han, and Lu 2004; Vincent 2011; Saiki 2008)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.9.2</span> Inter-subject correlations</h3>
<p>Across experiments, asymmetry in mean confidence (Hypothesis 1) and in response time (Hypothesis 4) were mostly aligned. This is consistent with previous reports of a negative correlation between response times and confidence across trials within participants <span class="citation">(Henmon 1911; Calder-Travis et al. 2020; Pleskac and Busemeyer 2010; Moran, Teodorescu, and Usher 2015)</span>. To test if this was the case across participants too, and not only across experiments, we fitted a mixed-effects regression model to data from all seven experiments with experiment as a random effect (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta RT \sim \Delta conf+(1+\Delta conf|exp)\)</span>). The association between confidence and RT effects was significant in this model (<span class="math inline">\(p&lt;0.001\)</span>; see Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:correlations-fig">3.5</a>; upper panel). In contrast, metacognitive asymmetry (difference between the area under the response conditional ROC curves, controlling for response bias) was not significantly associated with asymmetry in either confidence ratings (<span class="math inline">\(p=0.41\)</span>; see Fig. <a href="results.html#fig:correlations-fig">3.5</a>; lower panel) or reaction time (<span class="math inline">\(p=0.54\)</span>).</p>
